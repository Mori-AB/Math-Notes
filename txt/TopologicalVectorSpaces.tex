\setpart{Topological Vector Spaces}
\label{part:tvs}

Linear algebra provides a fundamental tool in mathematics;
we have made good use of it especially in our treatise of \(\Rmath^n\).
However, it does not cover some topics of large interest.
For example, the vector space of continuous functions
cannot be evaluated by most of the tools in linear algebra,
mainly because the space itself is infinite-dimensional.
Here we study topics for infinite-dimensional vector spaces
that linear algebra has glossed over with the aid of
topologies induced by norms.
