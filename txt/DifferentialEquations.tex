\setpart{Differential Equations}
\label{part:diffeq}

This part is devoted to the study of differential equations.
Since the birth of calculus,
it was proven useful as way to look at the derivative of the function
in order to study functions.

Nowadays, differential equations became a standard
to describe many phenomena in nature
whose behavior is determined by its current state.
However, people discovered that most are hard to solve analytically,
let alone the fact that some of them do not even have solutions.

In this part,
we observe the existence and uniqueness of solutions
for some important classes of equations.
Some methods for finding solutions are also discussed.
