\setchapter{Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations}
\label{chap:opde}

In this chapter,
we study examples of ordinary and partial differential equations.
Ordinary differential equations can be thought as
equations describing motion throughout time under specific conditions.
It can be proved from the Picard-Lindel\"of theorem that
such ordinary differential equations always have local solutions.

On the other hand,
partial differential equations typically describe states of medium,
whose rate of change is subject not only to time,
but also to the current state itself.
These equations rely heavily on geometric properties,
and are much more harder to solve analytically.

We study the heat and wave equations as
our typical examples of partial differential equations.
