\setpart{Measure Theory and Integration}
\label{part:measure}

Integration plays a crucial role in modern mathematics,
and is in some sense more ``universal'' compared to differentiation.
Historically, it was Eudoxos of Cnidus
who developed what we call today \emph{method of exhaustion}
to compute the area of a circle.
The idea is to approximate a given region with polygons of known area,
hence the limiting figure would have the same area as the region.
Archimedes then used this approach to compute many things, such as
the area bounded by a parabola and a secant,
the evaluation of an infinite geometric series,
and the bound for \(\pi\).

Integration was first formalized by
Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, the founders of calculus.
Then Riemann rigorously defined his theory of integration
by using partitions of the given domain.
However, it was Henri Lebesgue and his theory of measure
which generalized the concept of integration in its modern form.
It can also be demonstrated that
integration imposes a lot weaker condition than differentiation.
