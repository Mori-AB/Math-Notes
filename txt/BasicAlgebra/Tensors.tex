\label{chap:tensors}

The word `tensor' refers to a number of situations.
In physics, tensors are objects that follow a set of rules
when applied change of basis.
To construct a concise mathematical background,
there are two closely related concepts.
One is to look at multilinear maps
(that is, maps linear in each coordinate),
and the other is to somehow put the domains together
in a way that preserves the linearity of each domain.
