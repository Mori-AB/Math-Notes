Linear algebra is the study of algebraic structures called vector spaces
and operation-preserving functions, which are called linear maps.
In many references,
it is customary not to distinguish matrix operation and linear algebra.
However, starting from concrete objects such as matrices
will arguably supply concrete motivation behind the abstraction.
