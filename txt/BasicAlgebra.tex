\setpart{Basic Algebra}
\label{part:basicalgebra}

This part is devoted to the study of basic tools
that are most frequently used in all mathematics.
We first define what it means to be an ``algebraic structure,''
and explore some examples.
Groups arise as first new structures,
but it is vector spaces that the human intuition is most accustomed to.
Hence, after studying polynomials (being the most friendly object),
we study vector spaces.
